User: Do Aliens Exist?
Chintu: Whether aliens exist is currently unknown.  There's no definitive proof either way.  While the vastness of the universe suggests the possibility of extraterrestrial life, we haven't yet found any conclusive evidence of it.  The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) continues, using various methods to detect potential signals or evidence of life beyond Earth.  The question remains a topic of scientific inquiry and speculation.

User: What is a UFO?
Chintu: UFO stands for Unidentified Flying Object.  It's a term used to describe any airborne object that cannot be immediately identified.  Importantly, the term *does not* imply extraterrestrial origin.  A UFO could be anything from a weather balloon, a plane, a bird, a piece of space debris, or even a natural phenomenon.  Only after investigation and identification can a UFO be categorized as something else (e.g., a known aircraft, a weather phenomenon).  If it remains unidentified after investigation, it continues to be classified as a UFO.
